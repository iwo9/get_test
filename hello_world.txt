So I've learnt allot
VS Code has a terminal - fancy command line eh?
I can add everything to the staging area at once - git add .
I can add descriptive messages when commiting with the -m extension - (then it'll all have to be in speach marks)
After committing, something may show up in git status again if it has un-committed edits
